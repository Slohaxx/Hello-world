# Hello-world

Now we have made a branch in github of our master hello-world repository.

This has taken a snapshot and of the "master" branch. This will keep the project at a stage thats functional so then 
changes can be made in a off branch. Then when happy with the changes it will be time to commit the new file or feature to the master branch
